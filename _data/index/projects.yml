- name: Trajectory Visualization
  i18n: jalpc
  gh_user: lanzhige
  repo: serika_trajectory_visualization
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/trajvis.png
  desc: The trajectory visualization system is to visualize the change and trend of traffic flow in urban data. My job consists of a front-end website for component display and a back-end visualization data server for calculation tasks. The front-end visualization focuses on the distribution of traffics and the changes of trajectory directions. I used heatmap, radar chart, and patterns based on chord diagram to visualize the data on a website. The back-end server is implemented to provide the data to display. To speed up the calculation, I used GPU to parallel process the data. I have pushed the origin codes to my git repository.
